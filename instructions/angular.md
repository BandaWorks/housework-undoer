### Angular (based on angular-cli)

Official instruction is located at the official angular documentation: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.

If you don't have angular-cli installed yet, start from the installation section: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli

Here's the summary from angular's Getting Started page, but make sure to check out it out for expanded explanations and troubleshooting.

1\. Run in your terminal 

```sh
# if you have error "Command ng not found", run
# `npm install -g @angular/cli`
# first to install angular-cli
ng new app
cd app
```

It will create a subdirectory `app` (within your current directory) using [@angular/cli](https://angular.io/cli) and will change your current directory to `app`.

2\. Start the app using [ng](https://angular.io/cli#command-overview):

```
ng serve
```

Don't forget to commit the changes before starting coding :wink:

And yeah, that's it â€” you are ready to start coding!
