## What you'll build?

You will build a home chores management app. The app is requested by one parent struggling with his kids that ignore home responsibilities. Leverage a basic gamification and bright colors to encourage kids to help with home chores.


## Background story
Jack has been trying to teach his kids, Lily and Mary, to help their daddy with the housework.

So far he had to do all the housework alone: dust wiping, dishes, plants watering, you name it. Nevertheless, he kept trying. He always believed that a parent has to teach his children responsibility. And responsibility starts with the house.

Unfortunately, despite being young - Lily is 11 and Mary is 10 - his girls were always reluctant to help with "It's so boring, daddy" housework. Whenever possible, they would manage to find an excuse.

Recently,  Jack got a brilliant idea:
â€” What if I will put a reward on the housework tasks and when one of the girls finishes something, I'll give the reward to her?

With that, the idea for Housework Undoer was born.
