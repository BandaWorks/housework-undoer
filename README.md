Design: [Housework-Undoer in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/6pGrJ5d7blM1GZk8BXIEfH/Housework-Undoer)

## Instructions

### React

**Prerequisites:** You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To check them, run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

Complete instruction is located at the official create-react-app starting page: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started

Here's the short version, but make sure to check out that page for wider explanation and troubleshooting.

1\. Run in your terminal:
```
npx create-react-app app
cd app
npm start
```

It will create a subdirectory `app` (within your current directory) using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started), change your current directory to `app` and will start the dev server.

2\. Optinally, you can remove unnecessary files from source folder and only keep those that you will use:

```
app
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    └── index.js
```

> Alternatively you can use instruction provided by React docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html - see it for troubleshooting or for create-react-app alternatives.
