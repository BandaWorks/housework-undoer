### What you'll build?

You will build a home chores management app. The app is requested by one parent struggling with his kids that ignore home responsibilities. Leverage a basic gamification and bright colors to encourage kids to help with home chores.


### Background story

Jack has been trying to teach his kids, Lily and Mary, to help their daddy with the housework.

So far he had to do all the housework alone: dust wiping, dishes, plants watering, you name it. Nevertheless, he kept trying. He always believed that a parent has to teach his children responsibility. And responsibility starts with the house.

Unfortunately, despite being young - Lily is 11 and Mary is 10 - his girls were always reluctant to help with "It's so boring, daddy" housework. Whenever possible, they would manage to find an excuse.

Recently,  Jack got a brilliant idea:
â€” What if I will put a reward on the housework tasks and when one of the girls finishes something, I'll give the reward to her?

With that, the idea for Housework Undoer was born.


### Tasks

**Parents:**

- [ ] **The history**: I want to see my children's completed tasks so I could give them bonus reward if they do the housework regularly

- [ ] **List the chores**: I want to see list of housework tasks to know what tasks I've added and what tasks I should add next

- [ ] **Grant HC rewards**: I want to be able to change the HC balance of children to reward them when they cooperate with each other to deal with the house chores

**Children:** 

- [ ] **Today's housework**: I need to see the list of housework tasks with their rewards and descriptions,
so to learn what I can do to get the reward 

- [ ] **Completing the chore**: I want to complete the task to get the reward

- [ ] **Help Coins balance**: I want to see my balance so I could exchange Help Coins with my parents to get real money or things
